state space stuff, Advanced Linear.\\
comments on controller and estimator poles.\\
controller poles actually effect process. Would like it near origin for speed, but if they are too fast, the gain will be huge and your actuators might break.\\

in contrast, making the estimator have fast poles doesn't affect the motors. Might introduce noise into the sensor estimates.\\
