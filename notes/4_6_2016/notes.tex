\section*{state feedback design}
current estimator is similar to a prediction estimator, but with the term $L_p$ replaced with $\Phi L_c$. If you make a prediction estimator all you should have to do is find:
\[L_c=\Phi^{-1}L_p\]

current estimator error dynamics:
\[\tilde{x}(k)=x(k)-\bar{x}(k)\]
\[\tilde{x}(k+1)=(\Phi-\Phi L_cH)\tilde{x}(k)\]

Observability matrix $O_o$ doesn't change by replacing $H_c$ with $H\Phi$.\\
reduced order estimator where your output is one of the states, so you don't need to estimate it.\\
need to use this for furuta pendulum.\\
