review ecen 5458\\

digital controllers are used because they are much cheaper than analog controllers.\\
ZOH hold?\\

a digital signal is discrete in time and quantized (discrete in amplitude).\\

$\frac{1}{T}$ is greater than 30 times the closed loop system bandwidth and quantization is less than $2^{-15}$.\\

forward and backward difference approximations for differential equations.\\
How many points is optimal? (quadratic? cubic?)\\

lead lag compensator:
\[D(s)=\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}K_0\frac{s+a}{s+b},\quad a>0,\quad b>0\]
if a>b then lag, a<b then lead.\\
\[sU(s)+bU(s)=k_0(sE(s)+aE(s))\]
\[\dot{u}+bu=K_0(\dot{e}+ae)\]
\[\frac{u_{k+1}-u_k}{T}+bu_k=K_0\left (\frac{e_{k+1}-e_k}{T}\right )+K_0ae_k\]
then rewrite so that it is in the form $u_{k+1}=$\\
