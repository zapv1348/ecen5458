\section*{review of exam}
review\\
god I suck, should have gotten a 100 on this exam.\\

learn to sketch a root loci for every problem.\\
I fucked up real bad\\

\section*{state space design}
det(zI-$\phi$)=0 are the poles and characteristic equation.\\

start with 0 reference input, take a distrubance or initial condition and drown it out to zero.\\
Can we simply use linear state feedback.\\

can only do this if it is controllable. $det E=\left [\Gamma \Phi\Gamma \dots \Phi^{n-1}\Gamma\right ]$.\\

Controllability Gramian.\\

Controllable Canonical form, easy to solve for state-feedback vector.\\
super nice for this tpe of problem.\\
doing a state space transform to canonical form with $T$, and finding $K_c$ that makes it controllable, we can find the original $K=K_cT^{-1}$.\\
